# Machine-Learning-Prediction-Report
This project used machine learning to predict type 2 diabetes in Pima Indian women. A calibrated Random Forest model was chosen for its high recall (0.889) and strong clinical relevance. Key predictors matched known risk factors, highlighting ML's role in early, ethical diabetes detection.
